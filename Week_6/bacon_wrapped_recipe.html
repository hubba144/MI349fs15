  <h1>Bacon Wrapped Chicken Breast Recipe</h1>

  <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
  <ul>

<li>2 large skinless, boneless chicken breasts (450g each)</li>
<li>¼ tsp Himalayan or unrefined sea salt</li>
<li>10 slices organic, sugar free bacon</li>
<li>½ can (3-4 pieces) artichoke hearts, chopped</li>
<li>½ cup sliced water chestnuts, chopped</li>
<li>50g sundried tomatoes, finely chopped</li>
<li>¼ cup pine nuts</li>
<li>1 large clove garlic, minced</li>
<li>1 tsp fresh rosemary, finely chopped</li>
<li>1 tsp freshly cracked black pepper</li>
<li>½ tsp smoked paprika</li>

</ul>


<h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
<ol>

<li>First, make the stuffing by mixing all the ingredients in a small mixing bowl. Set aside.</li>
<li>Preheat your oven to 375F.</li>
<li>Now slice your chicken breasts open. To do that, place the blade of your knife parallel to your cutting board, put your hand flat on top of the breast and carefully slice down the middle almost all the way to the end. You’ll want to stop about ¾ of the way through.</li>
<li>Lay the chicken breasts open on a cutting board and, with a meat mallet or small saucepan, delicately pound them until they’re about ½ inch thick.</li>
<li>Place your now flat chicken breasts on your cutting board, sprinkle with salt and deposit half the stuffing in the middle of each breast. Spread the stuffing as evenly as possible but don't go all the way to the edge; you want to leave about one inch all around.</li>
<li>Roll the breasts as tightly as you can then carefully wrap each one with the bacon strips. I like to put 4 around and 1 across.</li>
<li>Place the breasts seam side down in a baking dish, cover loosely with aluminum foil and bake at 375F for 40 minutes.</li>
<li>Remove foil, drain pan juices (do not discard, this is tasty stuff!) and return to the oven, uncovered, for 15-20 minutes or until bacon is crispy.</li>
<li>If you want your bacon really crispy, you can set your oven to broil for the final 5 minutes or so. Keep a close eye on the prize, though. You wouldn’t want your precious bundles to burn!</li>
<li>Remove from oven, tent loosely and let the meat rest for 10-15 minutes before slicing.</li>
